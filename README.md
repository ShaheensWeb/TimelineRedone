# TimelineRedone
Here's the challenge:

Creating a project with the following requirements:

* When the app starts it downloads the latest 30 tweets from a user's timeline
* The App displays the tweets in a list (It should display profile picture and the actual tweet content)
* Add a "Pull-to-Refresh" mechanism to refresh the list of tweets

Progress will begin Sunday, June 5th 2016.
